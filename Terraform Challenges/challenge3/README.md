# CHALLENGE 3: Implementation of an EC2 Instance

This is the third challenge and it marks the end of the terraform challenge.

With this challenge, i was able to continue my familiarization with AWS resources and it was an interesting challenge.

I get to use call variables from a dedicated variable file rather than having it declared as an environmental variable.
Also, I learnt how to create a local-exec provisioner for an elastic IP. I was able to install ngix on an instance using the user_data argument.
