#The Nautilus application development team was working on a git repository /opt/official.git which is cloned under /usr/src/kodekloudrepos directory present on Storage server in Stratos DC. The team want to setup a hook on this repository, please find below more details:

#Merge the feature branch into the master branch`, but before pushing your changes complete below point.

#Create a post-update hook in this git repository so that whenever any changes are pushed to the master branch, it creates a release tag with name release-2023-06-15, where 2023-06-15 is supposed to be the current date. For example if today is 20th June, 2023 then the release tag must be release-2023-06-20. Make sure you test the hook at least once and create a release tag for today's release.

#Finally remember to push your changes.

create a file /hooks/post-update in the bare repo.
Then have the following code

#!/bin/bash

CURRENT_DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
TAG_NAME="release-$CURRENT_DATE"
exec git tag TAG_NAME

#change the script to executable

then go to the clone repo to merge the branches before subsequently pushing the repo
