#The Nautilus DevOps team is conducting application deployment tests on selected application servers. They require a nginx container deployment on Application Server 1. Complete the task with the following instructions:
#On Application Server 1 create a container named nginx_1 using the nginx image with the alpine tag. Ensure container is in a running state.

#docker ps
#docker image

# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
docker run -d --name nginx_1 -p 8080:80 nginx:alpine

#A container named kke-container was created by one of the Nautilus project developers on App Server 3. It was solely for testing purposes and now requires deletion. Execute the following task:
#Delete the kke-container on App Server 3 in Stratos DC.

docker kill kke-container ( you need to stop a running container before attempting to delete it)
docker rm kke-container


#The Nautilus DevOps team possesses confidential data on App Server 3 in the Stratos Datacenter. A container named ubuntu_latest is running on the same server. Copy an encrypted file /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg from the docker host to the ubuntu_latest container located at /home/. Ensure the file is not modified during this operation.

docker cp /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg ubuntu_latest:/home/

#An issue has arisen with a static website running in a container named nautilus on App Server 1. To resolve the issue, investigate the following details: Check if the container's volume /usr/local/apache2/htdocs is correctly mapped with the host's volume /var/www/html. Verify that the website is accessible on host port 8080 on App Server 1. Confirm that the command curl http://localhost:8080/ works on App Server 1.

docker ps -a
docker restart nautilus
