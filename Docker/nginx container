#The Nautilus DevOps team is conducting application deployment tests on selected application servers. They require a nginx container deployment on Application Server 1. Complete the task with the following instructions:
#On Application Server 1 create a container named nginx_1 using the nginx image with the alpine tag. Ensure container is in a running state.

#docker ps
#docker image

# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
docker run -d --name nginx_1 -p 8080:80 nginx:alpine

#A container named kke-container was created by one of the Nautilus project developers on App Server 3. It was solely for testing purposes and now requires deletion. Execute the following task:
#Delete the kke-container on App Server 3 in Stratos DC.

docker kill kke-container ( you need to stop a running container before attempting to delete it)
docker rm kke-container


#The Nautilus DevOps team possesses confidential data on App Server 3 in the Stratos Datacenter. A container named ubuntu_latest is running on the same server. Copy an encrypted file /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg from the docker host to the ubuntu_latest container located at /home/. Ensure the file is not modified during this operation.

docker cp /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg ubuntu_latest:/home/

#An issue has arisen with a static website running in a container named nautilus on App Server 1. To resolve the issue, investigate the following details: Check if the container's volume /usr/local/apache2/htdocs is correctly mapped with the host's volume /var/www/html. Verify that the website is accessible on host port 8080 on App Server 1. Confirm that the command curl http://localhost:8080/ works on App Server 1.

docker ps -a
docker restart nautilus

#Nautilus project developers are planning to start testing on a new project. As per their meeting with the DevOps team, they want to test containerized environment application features. As per details shared with DevOps team, we need to accomplish the following task: a. Pull busybox:musl image on App Server 2 in Stratos DC and re-tag (create new tag) this image as busybox:blog.

docker pull busybox:musl
docker tag busybox:musl busybox:blog

#One of the Nautilus developer was working to test new changes on a container. He wants to keep a backup of his changes to the container. A new request has been raised for the DevOps team to create a new image from this container. Below are more details about it:
#a. Create an image official:nautilus on Application Server 3 from a container ubuntu_latest that is running on same server.

docker commit ubuntu_latest official:nautilus

#One of the Nautilus DevOps team members was working to configure services on a kkloud container that is running on App Server 3 in Stratos Datacenter. Due to some personal work he is on PTO for the rest of the week, but we need to finish his pending work ASAP. Please complete the remaining work as per details given below: a. Install apache2 in kkloud container using apt that is running on App Server 3 in Stratos Datacenter. b. Configure Apache to listen on port 5001 instead of default http port. Do not bind it to listen on specific IP or hostname only, i.e it should listen on localhost, 127.0.0.1, container ip, etc. c. Make sure Apache service is up and running inside the container. Keep the container in running state at the end

docker exec -it kkloud /bin/sh
yum install apache2
cd /etc/apache2
ls -la
sed -i 's/Listen 80/Listen 50001/g' ports.conf
 service apache2 start
 service apache2 status

 #As per recent requirements shared by the Nautilus application development team, they need custom images created for one of their projects. Several of the initial testing requirements are already been shared with DevOps team. Therefore, create a docker file /opt/docker/Dockerfile (please keep D capital of Dockerfile) on App server 1 in Stratos DC and configure to build an image with the following requirements: a. Use ubuntu as the base image. b. Install apache2 and configure it to work on 3001 port. (do not update any other Apache configuration settings like document root etc).

vi /opt/docker/Dockerfile

FROM ubuntu
ARG DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install apache2 -y
RUN sed -i "s/80/8081/g" /etc/apache2/ports.conf
EXPOSE 8081
 CMD ["/usr/sbin/apache2ctl", "-D", "FOREGROUND", "-k", "start"]

cd /opt/docker
docker build -t apache2 .
docker run --name http -p 3081:3001 -d apache2
curl -Ik http://localhost:3001

#Nautilus developers are actively working on one of the project repositories, /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/beta. Recently, they decided to implement some new features in the application, and they want to maintain those new changes in a separate branch. Below are the requirements that have been shared with the DevOps team: On Storage server in Stratos DC create a new branch xfusioncorp_beta from master branch in /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/beta git repo. Please do not try to make any changes in the code.

git branch xfusioncorp_beta master


#The Nautilus application development team has been working on a project repository /opt/ecommerce.git. This repo is cloned at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos on storage server in Stratos DC. They recently shared the following requirements with DevOps team: Create a new branch nautilus in /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/ecommerce repo from master and copy the /tmp/index.html file (present on storage server itself) into the repo. Further, add/commit this file in the new branch and merge back that branch into master branch. Finally, push the changes to the origin for both of the branches.

cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/ecommerce
git branch nautilus master
cp /tmp/index.html /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/ecommerce
git checkout nautilus
git add .
 git commit -m "latest"
 git checkout master
 git merge -m "ljel" nautilus
 git push

 #The xFusionCorp development team added updates to the project that is maintained under /opt/apps.git repo and cloned under /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/apps. Recently some changes were made on Git server that is hosted on Storage server in Stratos DC. The DevOps team added some new Git remotes, so we need to update remote on /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/apps repository as per details mentioned below: a. In /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/apps repo add a new remote dev_apps and point it to /opt/xfusioncorp_apps.git repository. b. There is a file /tmp/index.html on same server; copy this file to the repo and add/commit to master branch. c. Finally push master branch to this new remote origin.

 cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/apps
 git remote add dev_apps /opt/xfusioncorp_apps.git
 cp /tmp/index.html /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/apps
 git push -u dev_apps master

 #The Nautilus application development team was working on a git repository /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/news present on Storage server in Stratos DC. However, they reported an issue with the recent commits being pushed to this repo. They have asked the DevOps team to revert repo HEAD to last commit. Below are more details about the task: In /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/news git repository, revert the latest commit ( HEAD ) to the previous commit (JFYI the previous commit hash should be with initial commit message ). Use revert news message (please use all small letters for commit message) for the new revert commit.

 cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/news
 git status
 git log
 git revert HEAD
git add .
git commit -m "revert news"
