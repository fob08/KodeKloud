#The Nautilus DevOps team is conducting application deployment tests on selected application servers. They require a nginx container deployment on Application Server 1. Complete the task with the following instructions:
#On Application Server 1 create a container named nginx_1 using the nginx image with the alpine tag. Ensure container is in a running state.

#docker ps
#docker image

# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
docker run -d --name nginx_1 -p 8080:80 nginx:alpine

#A container named kke-container was created by one of the Nautilus project developers on App Server 3. It was solely for testing purposes and now requires deletion. Execute the following task:
#Delete the kke-container on App Server 3 in Stratos DC.

docker kill kke-container ( you need to stop a running container before attempting to delete it)
docker rm kke-container


#The Nautilus DevOps team possesses confidential data on App Server 3 in the Stratos Datacenter. A container named ubuntu_latest is running on the same server. Copy an encrypted file /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg from the docker host to the ubuntu_latest container located at /home/. Ensure the file is not modified during this operation.

docker cp /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg ubuntu_latest:/home/

#An issue has arisen with a static website running in a container named nautilus on App Server 1. To resolve the issue, investigate the following details: Check if the container's volume /usr/local/apache2/htdocs is correctly mapped with the host's volume /var/www/html. Verify that the website is accessible on host port 8080 on App Server 1. Confirm that the command curl http://localhost:8080/ works on App Server 1.

docker ps -a
docker restart nautilus

#Nautilus project developers are planning to start testing on a new project. As per their meeting with the DevOps team, they want to test containerized environment application features. As per details shared with DevOps team, we need to accomplish the following task: a. Pull busybox:musl image on App Server 2 in Stratos DC and re-tag (create new tag) this image as busybox:blog.

docker pull busybox:musl
docker tag busybox:musl busybox:blog

#One of the Nautilus developer was working to test new changes on a container. He wants to keep a backup of his changes to the container. A new request has been raised for the DevOps team to create a new image from this container. Below are more details about it:
#a. Create an image official:nautilus on Application Server 3 from a container ubuntu_latest that is running on same server.

docker commit ubuntu_latest official:nautilus

#One of the Nautilus DevOps team members was working to configure services on a kkloud container that is running on App Server 3 in Stratos Datacenter. Due to some personal work he is on PTO for the rest of the week, but we need to finish his pending work ASAP. Please complete the remaining work as per details given below: a. Install apache2 in kkloud container using apt that is running on App Server 3 in Stratos Datacenter. b. Configure Apache to listen on port 5001 instead of default http port. Do not bind it to listen on specific IP or hostname only, i.e it should listen on localhost, 127.0.0.1, container ip, etc. c. Make sure Apache service is up and running inside the container. Keep the container in running state at the end

docker exec -it kkloud /bin/sh
yum install apache2
cd /etc/apache2
ls -la
sed -i 's/Listen 80/Listen 50001/g' ports.conf
 service apache2 start
 service apache2 status
